This can be downloaded from:-

http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-ODBC/5.3/mysql-connector-odbc-5.3.4-winx64.msi

Because both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions have the same full name, you MUST use one of the free MSI editors to edit the product name
from:-

"MySQL Connector/ODBC 5.3"

to:-

"MySQL Connector/ODBC 5.3 (64 bit)"
